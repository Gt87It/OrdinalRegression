# OrdinalRegression
A series of ordinal Logistic Regressions done with data of a publicily available dataset, the World Values Survey (https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp).

"The World Values Survey (WVS) is an international research program devoted to the scientific and academic study of social, political, economic, religious and cultural values of people in the world. The projectâ€™s goal is to assess which impact values stability or change over time has on the social, political and economic development of countries and societies."

The data is imported and cleaned.

After that, I look for missing values and I model a series of nonrobust ordinal regression models with and without interaction terms using statsmodels.

No data transformations are applied, no imputation methods are applied.
